Extensive UT2004 Modification

Gunreal is a UT2004 mod, completely redoing UT2004's combat and game mechanics with its own weapons and pacing.

It currently features: 
 * 14 New Weapons 
 * Weapon-Shopping 
 * Dynamic Inventory Belt 
 * Walk/Sprint Stamina 
 * Dynamic Accuracy 
 * Improved Player Size 
 * New Blood & Gore 
 * Hit Indicator 
 * Smooth Weapon Drag 
 * Grenades, Mines, and Deployable Teleporters

For those who are new to the mod, it essentially builds off UT2004 (though aiming to be its own thing entirely) to bring the weapons and combat to new levels of solidity, power, and feel of relentless destruction. Special care has been put into the explosions, effects, and especially sound design, with the specific intent (and challenge) of putting the feel of combat on a level higher than any other shooter in existence (but only you can tell us if we've succeeded or not).

Since this is NOT UT2004, however, pacing and gameplay is different. Movement is nearly identical to Half-Life 2 and Battlefield 2 (walk/sprint with stamina), and we use a completely original shopping/money system to add an almost RPG-like element of micromanagement and thought to the game. (see the trailer for details) Alongside all the violence and rage, we've put a great deal of thought into the strategy aspects of the game as well, in an attempt to cater to gamers of all play-styles and backgrounds.
